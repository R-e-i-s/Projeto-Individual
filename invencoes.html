            has the ability to manufacture two linked portals. No matter the
            distance between them, any object which passes through one portal
            will emerge from the other and vice versa instantaneously. The
            portals can be placed on any surface which is made out of
            manufactured or refined moon rock and large enough to accommodate
            them. When the ASHPD is fired, a burst of colored energy is emitted
            from the barrel, corresponding to the colored portal it is intended
            to create. Upon striking the targeted surface, a portal is formed,
            surrounded by a colored ring.
